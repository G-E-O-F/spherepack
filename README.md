# **modern\_spherepack - A modern Fortran (2008+) library of spherical harmonic transforms**

An object-oriented modernization of NCAR's SPHEREPACK3.2. 

* The original work, written in fixed-from FORTRAN 77, was heavily refactored to incorporate features of free-form modern Fortran (2008+). 
* Dynamic memory allocation procedures for analysis and synthesis are now hidden from the end user.
* **type**(Sphere) allows one to write generic code for both regular (uniform spacing) and Gaussian grids.

## What is spherepack?

A collection of Fortran programs for computing common spherical differential operators including divergence, vorticity, latitudinal derivatives, gradients, the Laplacian of both scalar and vector functions, and the inverses of these operators.

For example, given divergence and vorticity, the package can be used to compute velocity components, then the Laplacian inverse can be used to solve the scalar and vector Poisson equations. The package also contains routines for computing the associated Legendre functions, Gaussian points and weights, multiple fast Fourier transforms, and for converting scalar and vector fields between geophysical and mathematical spherical coordinates.

Test programs are provided for solving these equations. Each program serves two purposes: as a template to guide you in writing your own codes utilizing the spherepack routines, and as a demonstration on your computer that you can correctly produce spherepack executables.

## Usage

```fortran

	
    use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only: &
        wp => REAL64
        	
    use spherepack_library, only: &
        GaussianSphere

    ! Explicit typing only
    implicit none
    
    type (GaussianSphere)  :: foo
    real (wp), allocatable :: scalar_function(:,:)
    real (wp), allocatable :: laplacian(:,:)
    real (wp), allocatable :: solution(:,:)
    
    ! Initialize object
    foo = GaussianSphere(nlat=19, nlon=36)
    
    !.... generate some data
    
    ! Compute complex spectral coefficients
    call foo%perform_complex_analysis(scalar_function)
    
    ! Compute laplacian on sphere
    call foo%get_laplacian(scalar_function, laplacian)
    
    ! Invert laplacian on sphere
    call foo%invert_laplacian(laplacian, solution)
    
    ! Release memory
    call foo%destroy()
