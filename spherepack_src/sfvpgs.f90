!     subroutine sfvpgs(nlat, nlon, isym, nt, sf, vp, idv, jdv, br, bi, cr, ci, 
!    +                   mdb, ndb, wshsgs, lshsgs, work, lwork, ierror)
!
!     given the vector spherical harmonic coefficients br, bi, cr, ci, 
!     computed by subroutine vhags for a vector field (v, w), sfvpgs
!     computes a scalar stream function sf and scalar velocity potential
!     vp for (v, w).  (v, w) is expressed in terms of sf and vp by the
!     helmholtz relations (in mathematical spherical coordinates):
!
!          v = -1/sint*d(vp)/dlambda + d(st)/dtheta
!
!          w =  1/sint*d(st)/dlambda + d(vp)/dtheta
!
!     where sint = sin(theta).  w is the east longitudinal and v
!     is the colatitudinal component of the vector field from which
!     br, bi, cr, ci were precomputed.  required associated legendre
!     polynomials are stored rather than recomputed as they are in
!     subroutine sfvpgc. sf(i, j) and vp(i, j) are given at the i(th)
!     gaussian colatitude point theta(i) (see nlat description below)
!     and east longitude lambda(j) = (j-1)*2*pi/nlon on the sphere.
!
!     input parameters
!
!     nlat   the number of points in the gaussian colatitude grid on the
!            full sphere. these lie in the interval (0, pi) and are computed
!            in radians in theta(1) <...< theta(nlat) by subroutine gaqd.
!            if nlat is odd the equator will be included as the grid point
!            theta((nlat+1)/2).  if nlat is even the equator will be
!            excluded as a grid point and will lie half way between
!            theta(nlat/2) and theta(nlat/2+1). nlat must be at least 3.
!            note: on the half sphere, the number of grid points in the
!            colatitudinal direction is nlat/2 if nlat is even or
!            (nlat+1)/2 if nlat is odd.
!
!     nlon   the number of distinct londitude points.  nlon determines
!            the grid increment in longitude as 2*pi/nlon. for example
!            nlon = 72 for a five degree grid. nlon must be greater than
!            3.  the efficiency of the computation is improved when nlon
!            is a product of small prime numbers.
!
!
!     isym   a parameter which determines whether the stream function and
!            velocity potential are computed on the full or half sphere
!            as follows:
!
!      = 0
!
!            the symmetries/antsymmetries described in isym=1, 2 below
!            do not exist in (v, w) about the equator.  in this case st
!            and vp are not necessarily symmetric or antisymmetric about
!            the equator.  sf and vp are computed on the entire sphere.
!            i.e., in arrays sf(i, j), vp(i, j) for i=1, ..., nlat and
!            j=1, ..., nlon.
!
!      = 1
!
!            w is antisymmetric and v is symmetric about the equator.
!            in this case sf is symmetric and vp antisymmetric about
!            the equator and are computed for the northern hemisphere
!            only.  i.e., if nlat is odd the sf(i, j), vp(i, j) are computed
!            for i=1, ..., (nlat+1)/2 and for j=1, ..., nlon.  if nlat is
!            even then sf(i, j), vp(i, j) are computed for i=1, ..., nlat/2
!            and j=1, ..., nlon.
!
!      = 2
!
!            w is symmetric and v is antisymmetric about the equator.
!            in this case sf is antisymmetric and vp symmetric about
!            the equator and are computed for the northern hemisphere
!            only.  i.e., if nlat is odd the sf(i, j), vp(i, j) are computed
!            for i=1, ..., (nlat+1)/2 and for j=1, ..., nlon.  if nlat is
!            even then sf(i, j), vp(i, j) are computed for i=1, ..., nlat/2
!            and j=1, ..., nlon.
!
!     nt     nt is the number of scalar and vector fields.  some
!            computational efficiency is obtained for multiple fields. arrays
!            can be three dimensional corresponding to an indexed multiple
!            vector field.  in this case multiple scalar synthesis will
!            be performed to compute sf, vp for each field.  the
!            third index is the synthesis index which assumes the values
!            k=1, ..., nt.  for a single synthesis set nt = 1.  the
!            description of the remaining parameters is simplified by
!            assuming that nt=1 or that all the arrays are two dimensional.
!
!     idv    the first dimension of the arrays sf, vp as it appears in
!            the program that calls sfvpgs. if isym = 0 then idv
!            must be at least nlat.  if isym = 1 or 2 and nlat is
!            even then idv must be at least nlat/2. if isym = 1 or 2
!            and nlat is odd then idv must be at least (nlat+1)/2.
!
!     jdv    the second dimension of the arrays sf, vp as it appears in
!            the program that calls sfvpgs. jdv must be at least nlon.
!
!     br, bi, two or three dimensional arrays (see input parameter nt)
!     cr, ci  that contain vector spherical harmonic coefficients
!            of the vector field (v, w) as computed by subroutine vhags.
!
!     mdb    the first dimension of the arrays br, bi, cr, ci as it
!            appears in the program that calls sfvpgs. mdb must be at
!            least min(nlat, nlon/2) if nlon is even or at least
!            min(nlat, (nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd.
!
!     ndb    the second dimension of the arrays br, bi, cr, ci as it
!            appears in the program that calls sfvpgs. ndb must be at
!            least nlat.
!
!     wshsgs an array which must be initialized by subroutine shsgsi.
!            once initialized, wshsgs can be used repeatedly by sfvpgs
!            as long as nlon and nlat remain unchanged.  wshsgs must
!            not bel altered between calls of sfvpgs.
!
!
!     lshsgs the dimension of the array wshsgs as it appears in the
!            program that calls sfvpgs. define

!
!            and
!
!               l2 = nlat/2        if nlat is even or
!               l2 = (nlat+1)/2    if nlat is odd
!
!            then lshsgs must be at least
!
!            nlat*(3*(l1+l2)-2)+(l1-1)*(l2*(2*nlat-l1)-3*l1)/2+nlon+15
!
!
!     work   a work array that does not have to be saved.
!
!     lwork  the dimension of the array work as it appears in the
!            program that calls sfvpgs. define
!
!               l1 = min(nlat, (nlon+2)/2) if nlon is even or
!               l1 = min(nlat, (nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd
!
!            and
!
!               l2 = nlat/2                    if nlat is even or
!               l2 = (nlat+1)/2                if nlat is odd
!
!            if isym is zero then lwork must be at least
!
!                  nlat*nlon*(nt+1) + nlat*(2*l1*nt + 1)
!
!            if isym is nonzero then lwork must be at least
