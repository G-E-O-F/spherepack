    !     subroutine igradec(nlat, nlon, isym, nt, sf, isf, jsf, br, bi, mdb, ndb, &
    !                        wshsec, ierror)
    !
    !     let br, bi, cr, ci be the vector spherical harmonic coefficients
    !     precomputed by vhaec for a vector field (v, w).  let (v', w') be
    !     the irrotational component of (v, w) (i.e., (v', w') is generated
    !     by assuming cr, ci are zero and synthesizing br, bi with vhsec).
    !     then subroutine igradec computes a scalar field sf such that
    !
    !            gradient(sf) = (v', w').
    !
    !     i.e.,
    !
    !            v'(i, j) = d(sf(i, j))/dtheta          (colatitudinal component of
    !                                                 the gradient)
    !     and
    !
    !            w'(i, j) = 1/sint*d(sf(i, j))/dlambda  (east longitudinal component
    !                                                 of the gradient)
    !
    !     at colatitude
    !
    !            theta(i) = (i-1)*pi/(nlat-1)
    !
    !     and longitude
    !
    !            lambda(j) = (j-1)*2*pi/nlon
    !
    !     where sint = sin(theta(i)).  required associated legendre polynomials
    !     are recomputed rather than stored as they are in subroutine igrades. this
    !     saves storage (compare lshsec and lshses in igrades) but increases
    !     computational requirements.
    !
    !     note:  for an irrotational vector field (v, w), subroutine igradec
    !     computes a scalar field whose gradient is (v, w).  in ay case,
    !     subroutine igradec "inverts" the gradient subroutine gradec.
    !
    !
    !     input parameters
    !
    !     nlat   the number of colatitudes on the full sphere including the
    !            poles. for example, nlat = 37 for a five degree grid.
    !            nlat determines the grid increment in colatitude as
    !            pi/(nlat-1).  if nlat is odd the equator is located at
    !            grid point i=(nlat + 1)/2. if nlat is even the equator is
    !            located half way between points i=nlat/2 and i=nlat/2+1.
    !            nlat must be at least 3. note: on the half sphere, the
    !            number of grid points in the colatitudinal direction is
    !            nlat/2 if nlat is even or (nlat + 1)/2 if nlat is odd.
    !
    !     nlon   the number of distinct londitude points.  nlon determines
    !            the grid increment in longitude as 2*pi/nlon. for example
    !            nlon = 72 for a five degree grid. nlon must be greater than
    !            3.  the efficiency of the computation is improved when nlon
    !            is a product of small prime numbers.
    !
    !
    !     isym   a parameter which determines whether the scalar field sf is
    !            computed on the full or half sphere as follows:
    !
    !      = 0
    !
    !            the symmetries/antsymmetries described in isym=1, 2 below
    !            do not exist in (v, w) about the equator.  in this case sf
    !            is neither symmetric nor antisymmetric about the equator.
    !            sf is computed on the entire sphere.  i.e., in the array
    !            sf(i, j) for i=1, ..., nlat and  j=1, ..., nlon
    !
    !      = 1
    !
    !            w is antisymmetric and v is symmetric about the equator.
    !            in this case sf is antisymmetyric about the equator and
    !            is computed for the northern hemisphere only.  i.e.,
    !            if nlat is odd sf is computed in the array sf(i, j) for
    !            i=1, ..., (nlat + 1)/2 and for j=1, ..., nlon.  if nlat is even
    !            sf is computed in the array sf(i, j) for i=1, ..., nlat/2
    !            and j=1, ..., nlon.
    !
    !      = 2
    !
    !            w is symmetric and v is antisymmetric about the equator.
    !            in this case sf is symmetyric about the equator and
    !            is computed for the northern hemisphere only.  i.e.,
    !            if nlat is odd sf is computed in the array sf(i, j) for
    !            i=1, ..., (nlat + 1)/2 and for j=1, ..., nlon.  if nlat is even
    !            sf is computed in the array sf(i, j) for i=1, ..., nlat/2
    !            and j=1, ..., nlon.
    !
    !
    !     nt     nt is the number of scalar and vector fields.  some
    !            computational efficiency is obtained for multiple fields.
    !            the arrays br, bi, and sf can be three dimensional corresponding
    !            to an indexed multiple vector field (v, w).  in this case,
    !            multiple scalar synthesis will be performed to compute each
    !            scalar field.  the third index for br, bi, and sf is the synthesis
    !            index which assumes the values k = 1, ..., nt.  for a single
    !            synthesis set nt = 1.  the description of the remaining
    !            parameters is simplified by assuming that nt=1 or that br, bi,
    !            and sf are two dimensional arrays.
    !
    !     isf    the first dimension of the array sf as it appears in
    !            the program that calls igradec. if isym = 0 then isf
    !            must be at least nlat.  if isym = 1 or 2 and nlat is
    !            even then isf must be at least nlat/2. if isym = 1 or 2
    !            and nlat is odd then isf must be at least (nlat + 1)/2.
    !
    !     jsf    the second dimension of the array sf as it appears in
    !            the program that calls igradec. jsf must be at least nlon.
    !
    !     br, bi  two or three dimensional arrays (see input parameter nt)
    !            that contain vector spherical harmonic coefficients
    !            of the vector field (v, w) as computed by subroutine vhaec.
    !     ***    br, bi must be computed by vhaec prior to calling igradec.
    !
    !     mdb    the first dimension of the arrays br and bi as it appears in
    !            the program that calls igradec (and vhaec). mdb must be at
    !            least min(nlat, nlon/2) if nlon is even or at least
    !            min(nlat, (nlon + 1)/2) if nlon is odd.
    !
    !     ndb    the second dimension of the arrays br and bi as it appears in
    !            the program that calls igradec (and vhaec). ndb must be at
    !            least nlat.
    !
    !
    !  wshsec    an array which must be initialized by subroutine shseci.
    !            once initialized,
    !            wshsec can be used repeatedly by igradec as long as nlon
    !            and nlat remain unchanged.  wshsec must not be altered
    !            between calls of igradec.
    !
    !
    !  lshsec    the dimension of the array wshsec as it appears in the
    !            program that calls igradec. define
    !
    !               l1 = min(nlat, (nlon+2)/2) if nlon is even or
    !               l1 = min(nlat, (nlon + 1)/2) if nlon is odd
    !
    !            and
    !
    !               l2 = nlat/2        if nlat is even or
    !               l2 = (nlat + 1)/2    if nlat is odd.
    !
    !
    !            then lshsec must be greater than or equal to
    !
    !               2*nlat*l2+3*((l1-2)*(2*nlat-l1-1))/2+nlon+15
    !
    !     output parameters
    !
    !
    !     sf    a two or three dimensional array (see input parameter nt) that
    !           contain a scalar field whose gradient is the irrotational
    !           component of the vector field (v, w).  the vector spherical
    !           harmonic coefficients br, bi were precomputed by subroutine
    !           vhaec.  sf(i, j) is given at the gaussian colatitude theta(i)
    !           and longitude lambda(j) = (j-1)*2*pi/nlon.  the index ranges
    !           are defined at input parameter isym.
