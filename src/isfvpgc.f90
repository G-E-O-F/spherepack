!
!     subroutine isfvpgc(nlat, nlon, isym, nt, sf, vp, idv, jdv, as, bs, av, bv, 
!    +                   mdb, ndb, wvhsgc, lvhsgc, work, lwork, ierror)
!
!     given the scalar spherical harmonic coefficients as, bs precomputed
!     by shagc for the scalar stream function sf and av, bv precomputed by
!     shagc for the scalar velocity potenital vp, subroutine isfvpgc computes
!     the vector field (v, w) corresponding to sf and vp.  w is the east
!     longitudinal and v is the colatitudinal component of the vector field.
!     (v, w) is expressed in terms of sf, vp by the helmholtz relations (in
!     mathematical spherical coordinates):
!
!          v = -1/sin(theta)*d(vp)/dlambda + d(st)/dtheta
!
!          w =  1/sin(theta)*d(st)/dlambda + d(vp)/dtheta
!
!     required legendre functions are recomputed rather than stored as
!     they are in subroutine isfvpgs.  v(i, j) and w(i, j) are given at
!     the i(th) gaussian colatitude point (see compute_gaussian_latitudes_and_weights) theta(i) and east
!     longitude lambda(j) = (j-1)*2.*pi/nlon on the sphere.
!
!     input parameters
!
!     nlat   the number of points in the gaussian colatitude grid on the
!            full sphere. these lie in the interval (0, pi) and are computed
!            in radians in theta(1) <...< theta(nlat) by subroutine compute_gaussian_latitudes_and_weights.
!            if nlat is odd the equator will be included as the grid point
!            theta((nlat+1)/2).  if nlat is even the equator will be
!            excluded as a grid point and will lie half way between
!            theta(nlat/2) and theta(nlat/2+1). nlat must be at least 3.
!            note: on the half sphere, the number of grid points in the
!            colatitudinal direction is nlat/2 if nlat is even or
!            (nlat+1)/2 if nlat is odd.
!
!     nlon   the number of distinct londitude points.  nlon determines
!            the grid increment in longitude as 2*pi/nlon. for example
!            nlon = 72 for a five degree grid. nlon must be greater than
!            3.  the efficiency of the computation is improved when nlon
!            is a product of small prime numbers.
!
!
!     isym   a parameter which determines whether the vector field is
!            computed on the full or half sphere as follows:
!
!      = 0
!
!            the symmetries/antsymmetries described in isym=1, 2 below
!            do not exist in sf, vp about the equator.  in this case v
!            and w are not necessarily symmetric or antisymmetric about
!            equator.  v and w are computed on the entire sphere.
!            i.e., in arrays sf(i, j), vp(i, j) for i=1, ..., nlat and
!            j=1, ..., nlon.
!
!      = 1
!
!            vp is antisymmetric and sf is symmetric about the equator.
!            in this case v is symmetric and w antisymmetric about
!            the equator and are computed for the northern hemisphere
!            only.  i.e., if nlat is odd the v(i, j), w(i, j) are computed
!            for i=1, ..., (nlat+1)/2 and for j=1, ..., nlon.  if nlat is
!            even then v(i, j), w(i, j) are computed for i=1, ..., nlat/2
!            and j=1, ..., nlon.
!
!      = 2
!
!            vp is symmetric and sf is antisymmetric about the equator.
!            in this case v is antisymmetric and w symmetric about
!            the equator and are computed for the northern hemisphere
!            only.  i.e., if nlat is odd the v(i, j), w(i, j) are computed
!            for i=1, ..., (nlat+1)/2 and for j=1, ..., nlon.  if nlat is
!            even then v(i, j), w(i, j) are computed for i=1, ..., nlat/2
!            and j=1, ..., nlon.
!
!     nt     nt is the number of scalar and vector fields.  some
!            computational efficiency is obtained for multiple fields. arrays
!            can be three dimensional corresponding to an indexed multiple
!            vector field.  in this case multiple vector synthesis will
!            be performed to compute (v, w) for each field.  the
!            third index is the synthesis index which assumes the values
!            k=1, ..., nt.  for a single synthesis set nt = 1.  the
!            description of the remaining parameters is simplified by
!            assuming that nt=1 or that all the arrays are two dimensional.
!
!     idv    the first dimension of the arrays v, w as it appears in
!            the program that calls isfvpgc. if isym = 0 then idv
!            must be at least nlat.  if isym = 1 or 2 and nlat is
!            even then idv must be at least nlat/2. if isym = 1 or 2
!            and nlat is odd then idv must be at least (nlat+1)/2.
!
!     jdv    the second dimension of the arrays v, w as it appears in
!            the program that calls isfvpgc. jdv must be at least nlon.
!
!     as, bs  two or three dimensional arrays (see input parameter nt)
!            that contain the spherical harmonic coefficients of
!            the scalar field sf as computed by subroutine shagc.
!
!     av, bv  two or three dimensional arrays (see input parameter nt)
!            that contain the spherical harmonic coefficients of
!            the scalar field vp as computed by subroutine shagc.
!
!     mdb    the first dimension of the arrays as, bs, av, bv as it
!            appears in the program that calls isfvpgc. mdb must be at
!            least min(nlat, nlon/2) if nlon is even or at least
!            min(nlat, (nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd.
!
!     ndb    the second dimension of the arrays as, bs, av, bv as it
!            appears in the program that calls isfvpgc. ndb must be at
!            least nlat.
!
!     wvhsgc an array which must be initialized by subroutine vhsgci.
!            once initialized, wvhsgc can be used repeatedly by isfvpgc
!            as long as nlon and nlat remain unchanged.  wvhsgc must
!            not bel altered between calls of isfvpgc.
!
!
!     lvhsgc the dimension of the array wvhsgc as it appears in the
!            program that calls isfvpgc. define
!
!               l1 = min(nlat, nlon/2) if nlon is even or
!               l1 = min(nlat, (nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd
!
!            and
!
!               l2 = nlat/2        if nlat is even or
!               l2 = (nlat+1)/2    if nlat is odd
!
!            then lvhsgc must be at least
!
!
!               4*nlat*l2+3*max(l1-2, 0)*(nlat+nlat-l1-1)+nlon+15
!
!
!     work   a work array that does not have to be saved.
!
!     lwork  the dimension of the array work as it appears in the
!            program that calls isfvpgc. define
!
!               l1 = min(nlat, nlon/2) if nlon is even or
!               l1 = min(nlat, (nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd
!
!            and

!
!            if isym = 0 then lwork must be at least
!
!               nlat*(2*nt*nlon+max(6*l2, nlon)+4*l1*nt+1)
!
!            if isym = 1 or 2 then lwork must be at least
